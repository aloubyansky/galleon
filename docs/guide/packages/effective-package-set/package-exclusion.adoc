#### Explicit package exclusion

A package may be explicitly excluded from the feature-pack's effective package set. For example, given the following feature-pack definition (`feature-pack.xml`):

[source,xml]
----
 <feature-pack xmlns="urn:jboss:galleon:feature-pack:2.0"
                location="fp1@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe):1#1.0.0" >
    <default-packages>
        <package name="p1" />
        <package name="p2" />
    </default-packages>
 </feature-pack>
----

and assuming that

* package `p1` has an optional dependency on non-default package `p11`,

* package `p2` has an optional dependency on non-default package `p22`.

The original effective package set of `fp1` includes `p1`, `p11`, `p2` and `p22`.

If a user is interested in a subset of the effective package set, in fact, only in package `p1`, for example, it can be expressed in the provisioning XML configuration file as

[source,xml]
----
 <installation xmlns="urn:jboss:galleon:provisioning:2.0">
     <feature-pack location="fp1@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe):1#1.0.0">
         <packages>
             <exclude name="p11"/>
             <exclude name="p2"/>
         </packages>
     </feature-pack>
 </installation>
----

Packages `p11` and `p2` are explicitly excluded and package `p22` is a non-default package which is not a direct or transitive dependency of the packages to be installed, i.e. `p1`.
