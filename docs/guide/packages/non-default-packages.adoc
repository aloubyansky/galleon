### Feature-pack non-default packages

Feature-pack may contain packages that are not marked as default in its `feature-pack.xml`. Non-default packages can be installed either:

*   implicitly, in case a non-default package appears to be a transitive dependency of a default package;

*   explicitly, in case a user explicitly selected a non-default package to be installed.
