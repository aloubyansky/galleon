### Package directory structure

Packages are stored in the directories (named after the packages) under the feature-pack `packages` directory.

Package directory contains the following entries:

*   *package.xml* - the metadata describing the package;
*   _(optional)_ *content* - directory containing the content of the package which will be copied to the installation when the package is installed;
*   _(optional)_ *pm* - directory containing various resources needed to properly provision the content of the package.

Here is an illustration of `packages` entry from a feature-pack archive containing packages `p1`, `p2`, `p3` and `p4`:
