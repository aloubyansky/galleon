## Feature-packs

Feature-pack represents a released unit of software (project, product, component, etc) that can be installed or uninstalled using Galleon tools. Feature-packs are ZIP archives that are normally deployed by the feature-pack producers to artifact repositories (such as Maven) where they can be discovered and consumed by users using Galleon tools.

Feature-pack contains:

* metadata describing

** dependencies on other feature-packs;

** the default configuration(s) of the product the feature-pack represents;

** the package set that should be installed by default;

* _(optional)_ a set of packages (that represent various filesystem content);

* _(optional)_ a set of configuration feature specs (used to define and/or tune parts of the product configuration);

* _(optional)_ various resources required to properly assemble and configure the product;

* _(optional)_ product-specific provisioning plug-ins.


NOTE: Feature-pack may declare dependencies on other feature-packs. Before a feature-pack is installed the tool will make sure its dependencies are satisifed (by installing the missing ones).
