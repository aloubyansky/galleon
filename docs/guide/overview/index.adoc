## Overview

Galleon is a provisioning tool designed to create and maintain software distributions that consist of one or more products (or components). The tool supports:

* adding products to a distribution;

** their default and custom configurations;

* removing products from a distribution;

* integration of the products in the distribution;

* resolution and validation of the resulting configuration and runtime dependencies;

* patching and version updates;

* product-specific provisioning plugins;

* identification of the changes to the provisioned distribution (the FS content and/or the configuration) applied manually or using thirdparty tools;

* exporting the description of the current state of the distribution with the goal to reproduce it later at another location.

The tool includes a command-line interface and a public API. There is also a Maven plugin that allows provisioning a distribution according to the provided configuration.
